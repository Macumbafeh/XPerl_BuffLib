# XPerl_BuffLib
# DISABLE YOUR SEPARATE BUFFLIB ADDON

X-Perl with BuffLib included (all timers update correctly if your partner is using BuffLib too).
Use this, if you are using X-Perl and had problems with BuffLib timers before. Make sure your partners are using BuffLib, this XPerl or ArenaLive as well.
